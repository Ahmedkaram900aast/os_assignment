# Banker Algorithm in Flutter

This is a Flutter app that implements the banker algorithm for deadlock avoidance in operating systems. The app takes as input the maximum resource requirements, current allocation, and available resources for a set of processes, and computes a safe sequence of processes that can be executed without leading to deadlock.

## Getting Started

To use this app, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the repository in your preferred code editor.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
4. Launch an emulator or connect a physical device to your computer.
5. Run `flutter run` to build and launch the app.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can input the maximum resource requirements, current allocation, and available resources for a set of processes. The app will then compute a safe sequence of processes that can be executed without leading to deadlock, and display the output on a separate screen.
